# Product360

## Introduction

Product360 is a project created for learning and understanding Hibernate ORM functionalities. This hands-on practice is aimed at gaining proficiency in implementing Hibernate for various operations like CRUD, sorting, filtering, and data retrieval. It is not intended as a production-ready system but as a personal learning endeavor.

### What I Learned in Hibernate üéØ
- **Object Relational Mapping (ORM):** Understanding the mapping between Java objects and database tables.
- **Configuration and Setup:** Setting up Hibernate configuration files and mapping files.
- **Session Management:** Using Hibernate `SessionFactory` to manage database sessions.
- **CRUD Operations:** Creating, reading, updating, and deleting data with Hibernate.
- **Query Language:** Writing HQL (Hibernate Query Language) for complex data queries.
- **Transaction Management:** Ensuring consistency and atomicity during database operations.
- **Annotations and XML Mapping:** Using annotations for entity configuration and alternative XML mappings.
- **Lazy and Eager Fetching:** Managing data fetching strategies to optimize performance.
